# Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain
Utilized Power BI to analyze historical booking data, generated key metrics and built dynamic dashboards with charts and filters. This enabled stakeholders to track revenue performance and make informed decisions to drive revenue growth.

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Here are the questions I was interested in answering 
1) What factors could potentially explain the significant drop in revenue during the month of June, considering the decrease in total bookings, occupancy rate, and rise in unused capacity?
2) How might the consistent cancellation rates over three months impact revenue management strategies, and what steps could be taken to address this issue?
3) What implications do the consistent average ratings throughout the project have on customer satisfaction and retention, and how might this information be leveraged to improve business performance?
4) What strategies could be implemented to further capitalize on the consistently high revenue contribution from Mumbai and Bangalore?
5) How can the performance disparities between Atliq Exotica and Atliq Palace versus Atliq Seasons be addressed to optimize revenue generation across all properties?

## I took the following steps to create my analysis
1) Retrieved data from Excel files containing relevant information.
2) Ensured data integrity by cleaning and preparing it for analysis, removing any inconsistencies or errors.
3) Identified and established essential KPIs crucial for performance evaluation.
4) Developed charts and visual representations to effectively communicate insights derived from the data.
5) Implemented slicers to enable dynamic filtering and exploration of data.
6) Constructed a comprehensive dashboard integrating all components for easy monitoring and analysis.

## Here are my key takeaways
1) In June month, 4.8% drop in revenue! Total bookings decrease, occupancy falls, and unused capacity is on the rise.
2) Surprisingly, not the cause of the June revenue drop. Consistent cancellation rates over three months.
3) No surprises! Average ratings remain consistent throughout the project.
4) Mumbai and Bangalore consistently contribute high revenue.
5) Atliq Exotica and Atliq Palace lead in revenue, while Atliq Seasons lags behind.
6) MakeYourTrip secures the 2nd highest revenue, and an unidentified source takes the lead.
7) Clear ups and downs, with a noticeable dip in the last three weeks affecting bookings and revenue.
8)  Consistently outstanding performance, leading in revenue and maintaining a low cancellation rate.
